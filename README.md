This is a simple one-page app that tracks a links to translated pages. If you have to do this often, it can be very useful. The links are saved on to your hard drive so you can come back to the page as you left it off.

This is one of a few quick and dirty apps that I like to build to solve a problem that I have. Hopefully, this will solve many others' problems.
